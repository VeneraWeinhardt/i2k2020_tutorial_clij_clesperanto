# Compile and run a CLIc script

Up for a more complex challenge?

Download both the [CLIc Library](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype) and the [CLIc template project](https://github.com/StRigaud/CLIc_project_template). 
And compile the CLIc template project using CMake.
Then modify the project to apply a 2D Gaussian Blur operation to an image.

## Hints

[Guideline](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype/blob/master/docs/clic_compile_guide.md) and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype/blob/master/docs/clic_prerequish_install.md) can be found in the CLIc project documentation.

The current CLIc template project executable is configured to take an input .tif filename and an output .tif filename as parameters.
